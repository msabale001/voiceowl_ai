**Overview**

This repository demonstrates an end-to-end DevSecOps implementation for deploying a Node.js/Express application into a secure, production-grade Kubernetes environment, simulating an AWS EKS architecture locally.

The project covers:

Secure containerization
CI/CD pipeline security gates
Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
Kubernetes hardening
Observability (optional)
Security & compliance assessment
